# 🛍️ AFCSystem

**Automated Fee Collection System** is a full-stack web application designed to provide a simple and effective way of collecting bus fee digitally. 
It captures bus plates at the terminal entrance, then calculates the required fee and sends that particular fee as sms to the registered bus owner for payment within a specific period of time. 
The platform uses AI model to convert the captured plate image into a string, and sends to an endpoint for evaluation and sms sending.
The image capturing is done by a py-camera, while the model is stored in a raspberry-py microprocessor.
